Translating Human Readable Dates Into Machine Readable Dates :-
The network will learn to output dates in the common machine-readable format YYYY-MM-DD.
The network will input a date written in a variety of possible formats (e.g. "the 29th of August 1958", "03/30/1968", "24 JUNE 1987")
and then it will translate them into standardized, machine readable format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. "1958-08-29", "1968-03-30", "1987-06-24").
